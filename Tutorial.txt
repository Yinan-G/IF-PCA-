The implementation of IF-PCA+ consists of two parts: a manifold fitting part and an IF-PCA part.

The manifold fitting method is implemented in Matlab. The original code is from Professor Zhigang Yao's scAMF paper.
The IF-PCA part is implemented in Python.

To run IF-PCA+ on a selected dataset:
1. Open the "Yao2_denoising.m" file from Matlab and select the desired dataset by modifying the name varaible.
If the dataset selected contains negative entries, comment out the codes corresponding to log transformation. The denoised data array will be saved under "datasetname_Y2_denoised_data.mat"

2. Open the IFPCAplus file in Python and run the code accordingly.
